# Category tests

## Snapshot tests

Take snapshots of the DrinkOfTheDay component and compare them to the previous snapshot. If the snapshot has changed, the test will fail.
We tests with snapshots to make sure that the category does not change unexpectedly.

## Rendering

Tests that the drink renders correctly with the correct content when a drink is fetched.

## Correct links and navigation

Tests that the drink of the day links to the correct pages and that the navigation works as expected.
