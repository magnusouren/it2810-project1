# Category tests

## Snapshot tests

Take snapshots of the category component and compare them to the previous snapshot. If the snapshot has changed, the test will fail.
We tests with snapshots to make sure that the category does not change unexpectedly.

## Rendering

Tests that the category renders correctly with the correct content when a category is passed as a prop.

## Correct links and navigation

Tests that the category links to the correct pages and that the navigation works as expected.

## Correct navigation with state

Tests that the category is passed as a state to the next page when the category is clicked.
