# DrinkCard tests

## Snapshot tests

Take snapshots of the DrinkCard component and compare them to the previous snapshot. If the snapshot has changed, the test will fail.
We test with snapshots to make sure that the layout of the DrinkCard does not change unexpectedly.

## Rendering

Tests that the DrinkCard renders correctly with the correct content when an id is specified as a dynamic route.

## Correct links and navigation

Tests that the "Go Back" button works as expected.
