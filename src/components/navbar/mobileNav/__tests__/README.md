# MobileNav tests

## Snapshot tests

Takes snapshots of the navbar component and compares them to the previous snapshot. If the snapshot has changed, the test will fail.
We tests with snapshots to make sure that the navbar does not change unexpectedly.

## Correct rendering

Tests that the navbar renders correctly with the correct content.

## Correct links and navigation

Tests that the navbar links to the correct pages and that the navigation works as expected.
