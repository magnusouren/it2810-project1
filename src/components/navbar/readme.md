# Navbar

## Responsiveness

The web-app wil render different navbars depending on the screen size. The navbar will be at the top of screen for mobile devices and to the left of the page for larger screens.

## Testing

The navbars is tested separately since the test environment doesn't mind the screen size.
The responsiveness is tested manually by changing the screen size and checking if the navbar changes.

The tests for the different navbars is located in the components folders
