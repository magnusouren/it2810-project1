# SearchCategory tests

## Snapshot tests

Take snapshots of the SearchCategory component and compare them to the previous snapshot. If the snapshot has changed, the test will fail.
We tests with snapshots to make sure that the category does not change unexpectedly.

## Rendering

Tests that the component renders correctly with the correct content when the categories are fetched.
