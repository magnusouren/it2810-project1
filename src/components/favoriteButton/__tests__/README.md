# Favorite Button tests

## Snapshot tests

The snapshot test is used to make sure that the FavoriteButton component is rendered correctly. It is also used to make sure that the component doesn't change unexpectedly.

## Unit tests

The tests ensure the behavour of the component is correct. The tests are written to ensure that the component toggles the favorite button correctly.

We are not testing that the toggling function is called when clicking the button since the function is a part of the component and not reachable from the test.
