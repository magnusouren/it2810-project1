# Drinklist tests

## Snapshot tests

Take snapshots of the DrinkList component and compare them to the previous snapshot. If the snapshot has changed, the test will fail.
We tests with snapshots to make sure that the DrinkList does not change unexpectedly.

## Rendering

Tests that the list renders correctly with the correct content when all drinks are fetched.
