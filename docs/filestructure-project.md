# Project file structure

To maintain an organized structure in the project, files are organized like the diagram below:

```
├── coverage                    # test coverage reports (ignored by git)
├── dist                        # build files (ignored by git)
├── docs                        # documentation files
├── node_modules                # node modules (ignored by git)
├── src
│   ├── assets                  # static files
│   ├── components              # components
│   ├── pages                   # project pages
│   ├── utils                   # shared utility files
│   ├── main.tsx                # main file for the project
│   ├── routes.tsx              # project routing
├── configuration files         # project configuration files

```

This structure makes it easier to locate and manage different types of files and resources.
